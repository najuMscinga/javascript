This happened after Hang Tuah was falsely accused of treason by a jealous courtier and sentenced to death by the Sultan. However, he was secretly saved by his friend Tun Teja, who hid him in a cave. Meanwhile, Hang Jebat avenged his friend by rebelling against the Sultan and taking over the palace. He killed many officials and nobles who had wronged Hang Tuah. When Hang Tuah learned about this, he was conflicted between his loyalty to his friend and his loyalty to his ruler. He decided to confront Hang Jebat and challenge him to a duel. The duel lasted for seven days and seven nights, until Hang Tuah finally killed Hang Jebat with his famous weapon, the Kris Taming Sari.
